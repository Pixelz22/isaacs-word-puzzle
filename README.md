# Unnamed Word Puzzle

**! ALL CREDIT FOR THIS GAME CONCEPT AND DESIGN GOES TO ISAAC JOHN KNEUBUHL !**

I just made the UI and webpage :)

## The Game
The goal of the game is to get from the starting word to the target word
in as few moves as possible.

Valid moves will either:
- Change a single letter, OR
- Make an anagram (rearrange the letters).

All moves must form a real 5-letter word.
